# Release Status & Backlog — TeleCam Pro

Current release board. Read after `CLAUDE.md`; use `ARCHITECTURE.md` for implementation details.
Historical investigation notes are snapshots under `docs/reviews/` and `.context/reviews/`, not
active TODO lists. Updated 2026-07-10.

## Release State

Version 1.0 (`versionCode=1`) is ready for Play Console upload at the code, packaging, and physical-
device verification levels. The upload artifact is:

`app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`

Its SHA-256 and signing certificate are recorded in `docs/play-console-submit.md`. Rebuilds produce a
new hash and must update that sheet after the full release gate is repeated.

### Verified 2026-07-10

- Release build, bundle, lint, and the then-current JVM suite passed. The suite has since grown;
  re-run the release gate before upload and treat `app/src/test/` as the source of truth rather than
  copying a test/task count here.
- `bundletool 1.18.3 validate`, APK v2 signing, and 16 KiB zip alignment passed.
- Manifest has target/min SDK 36, no `INTERNET`, and no `DEBUGGABLE` flag.
- The installed PMA110 release APK matched the local verified APK byte-for-byte.
- Fresh state starts on 1x / 23 mm with TELE off.
- Remember Settings, Preserve Lens, and Preserve TELE default on; lens and TELE restore independently.
- Rapid double-shutter produces one serialized DNG+HEIF pair; both files are valid.
- 4K HLG records HEVC Main10 at 30000/1001 with AAC 48 kHz stereo.
- Open Gate records 2560x1920 4:3 HEVC Main10 at 30000/1001 with AAC.
- Core photo/video UI, menu hierarchy, settings persistence, and Play screenshots were reviewed on
  the physical PMA110. No crash or ANR was observed.

### Verified 2026-07-14 — seamless zoom + capture-pipeline session
1. **iPhone-style seamless zoom (photo)** — logical camera 0 (zoomRatio 0.6–20, physIds 3/2/4/5),
   pinch never reopens; lens picks = zoom presets; OSD shows the live effective focal.
   Device-verified: zero reopens across a 0.6→10 sweep.
2. **Video re-homed to standalone lenses** — the logical camera's EIS (Standard AND Active) leaks
   its uncorrected warp margin (~6% of width) into the preview AND the recorded file (verified by
   frame extraction; shows as a rainbow band at the bottom in portrait playback).
   `resolveNonTeleId` splits camera homes by mode; `setVideoMode` remaps unified↔lens-local zoom.
3. **Shutter could permanently wedge on the logical camera** — gralloc rejects its HAL-JPEG blob
   (the image never arrives) and a RAW target errors the camera device ~5 s post-shot. Fixed:
   YUV stills via `StillSnapshot`, RAW gated standalone-only (DNG = TELE mode), an 8 s capture
   watchdog, and instant shutter-blink feedback (the physical lag is pipeline-depth ×
   frame-duration: ~0.85 s at a 1/10 s dark-room preview, ~0.3–0.5 s in normal light).
4. **Zoom lag/jank, three layers** — full-request rebuild per tick (→ controller fast path on a
   cached repeating builder), per-input-event state updates at ~120 Hz (→ 16 ms/~60 Hz coalescing;
   compounding inputs MUST base on the coalesced pending value, not the stale UI state), and a
   ~33 MB full-res analysis glReadPixels every 5th frame (→ aspect-matched FBO, ≤256 px long edge).
5. **REC tally border vanished at the panel's rounded corners** — now follows the physical corner
   radius (WindowInsets RoundedCorner API, ×1.2 squircle compensation, user-tuned on device).
6. **UI pills** — Fn-row edge-fade scroll hint; one shared 12 dp left inset (OSD / meter / Fn row).

### Verified 2026-07-14 (late) — 0x80b4 TC session experiment (user-landed, agent-verified)
- The stock app's TC operation_mode **0x80b4 passes through to the HAL** as a plain
  SessionConfiguration sessionType on the standalone 3× camera: CamX logs
  `configure_streams() operation_mode: 0x80b4`, the session configures at fallback=0 WITH RAW,
  stills (HEIC+DNG) and 4K HEVC recording work, and TELE off returns cleanly to 0x0. No
  CameraUnit AUTH_CODE involved — this may be the 300 mm TC OIS profile unlock (stock pairs the
  mode with sensor mode 48). **Residual field check:** mount the converter and A/B the shake
  damping at 300 mm vs the previous SESSION_REGULAR build to confirm the OIS profile actually
  differs (result metadata shows ois=1/vstab=2 either way).

## Before Production

These are manual Play Console operations, not repository implementation work:

1. Create the app and upload the signed AAB to Internal testing.
2. Enter the listing, privacy policy, App content, and Data Safety answers from `docs/play-*.md`.
3. Upload the icon, feature graphic, and six 1440x2560 phone screenshots.
4. Restrict the device catalog to OPPO Find X9 Ultra codes CPH2841 and PMA110.
5. Install from Internal testing and review Play's automated checks and pre-launch report.
6. Promote the same tested artifact to production.

Use `docs/play-console-submit.md` as the operator checklist. The account was created in 2015, so the
new-personal-account closed-test rule does not apply; an internal test remains the release gate.

## Residual Field Checks

These do not require a code or metadata change unless the result exposes a defect:

- Record the same real scene with Sound Focus/Stage on and off, then compare off-axis rejection.
  Camera/HAL parameter acceptance is verified; the acoustic effect needs ears and a suitable scene.
- Capture a clearly upright subject while deliberately holding the phone in portrait and both
  landscape directions. Confirm HEIF display orientation and DNG EXIF orientation in saved files.
  Rotation math and flat-phone orientation retention are unit-tested; this closes the final visual
  output check. Also confirm a held-landscape VIDEO clip in an external gallery (the muxer
  orientation-hint SIGN is unverified — `RotationMath.videoOrientationHint` pins the current
  mapping and is the one place to flip if wrong).
- Added by the 2026-07-10 review cycle (code changed since the recorded release AAB — re-run the
  full release gate and refresh `docs/play-console-submit.md`'s hash before upload):
  one HEIF capture on heifwriter 1.1.0 (stable, was 1.2.0-alpha01); waveform overlay visual parity
  after the drawPoints batching; the new OSD AE/AWB/AF lock tags + TeleChip hit-area layout on the
  3168 px screen; a TalkBack pass over the new dial/slider semantics.

## Deferred Beyond v1

- **R8/minify:** keep disabled until enum persistence and reflection-sensitive OEM SDK paths have
  explicit keep rules and another physical-device release pass.
- **Dolby Vision:** hardware support exists, but a correct Dolby Vision MP4 path is not implemented.
- **End-to-end 10-bit Camera2 input:** the stable shipping Camera2/EGL source is SDR/8-bit; the prior
  HLG10 + JPEG + RAW combination crashed the HAL.
- **Authenticated CameraUnit path:** requires OPPO developer registration, an issued `AUTH_CODE`, and
  a product decision on a separate video session that lacks the current RAW/manual Camera2 surface.
- **Optional product work:** configurable keep-screen-on, geotagging, custom save locations, slow-
  motion playback metadata, and advanced focus/bracketing workflows.
- **True wide-field TELE finder (design item, owner decision needed):** the shipped Tele Finder
  PIP (Assist toggle, default OFF) honestly re-draws the FULL current camera frame — the single
  Camera2 stream already carries the HAL's `CONTROL_ZOOM_RATIO` crop, so no GL work can show a
  genuinely wider field. A real iPhone-style wide finder needs either (a) a second concurrent
  wide stream (high risk on this HAL — physical-sub-camera routing and several multi-stream
  combos crash it; must be device-verified per session plan), or (b) capping the HAL zoom and
  rendering the remaining main-view magnification in GL (touches AE metering, tap-AF region
  mapping, video encoder framing, and preview sharpness — a zoom-architecture change, not a
  finder change). Either path needs a deliberate design + device A/B before implementation.

## Deferred from review-plan-fix cycle 1 (2026-07-17 run; durable record)

Full records in `docs/plans/2026-07-17-rpf-cycle1.md` § Deferrals:

- **AGG-19 (Low/Medium)** — `FINDER_MIN_ZOOM = 1.15` is likely too low to be useful. Exit: a
  device session with the converter mounted tunes the threshold (or a zoomComp-based gate).
- **AGG-20 (Low/Medium)** — app-side AE ticks pay full repeating-request rebuilds (~180 ms HAL
  stall each; post-gesture photo-P re-center emits a submit train). Exit: device measurement; if
  visible, add a sensor-keys-only fast path on the cached builder (same pattern as zoom).

## Verification Quick Reference

```bash
export JAVA_HOME="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@21/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home"
export PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH"

./gradlew testDebugUnitTest lintRelease assembleRelease bundleRelease
adb connect <device-ip>:<port>
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
adb shell am start -n me.hletrd.telecampro/com.hletrd.findx9tele.MainActivity
```

The wireless-debugging port changes by session. On this multi-homed Mac, direct ADB can report
`No route to host`; proxy the current phone port to a temporary loopback port, connect to
`127.0.0.1:<proxy-port>`, and stop the proxy when verification ends. Do not reuse a recorded old port.

Runtime CAMERA and RECORD_AUDIO permissions are granted through the app UI on ColorOS. The `camtest`
AVD is suitable only for UI/crash checks; telephoto routing, RAW, color, audio, stabilization, and
saved-file behavior require PMA110.

## Deferred from review-plan-fix cycle 2 (2026-07-10 run; durable record)

That 2026-07-10 loop ended with its cycle 2 (later runs — 2026-07-16 cycles 1-9 and the 2026-07-17
loop — have their own dated plans under `docs/plans/`), so the 2026-07-10 deferrals live HERE, not
"in the next cycle." Full citations, severities, and exit criteria:
`docs/plans/2026-07-10-rpf-cycle2.md` § Deferred (D-1..D-18). Summary of what remains open:

- **Device re-verification of the cycle-2 changes** — the PMA110 re-locked behind a secure keyguard
  mid-cycle. VERIFIED on device post-unlock by the orchestrator (2026-07-10): letterboxed preview
  geometry photo 4:3 / video 9:16, photo↔video mode-switch reopens, tap-AF reticle (plus the
  3ba28c8 AspectMask axis follow-up). STILL QUEUED: review-overlay hardware-key gating, resume/
  lens-tap serialization under load, record start/stop under the ordered encoder teardown,
  MediaReview tap-to-pause, flat-resume capture orientation.
- **D-1** muxer orientation-hint SIGN (already in Residual Field Checks above).
- **D-2** confirm the Play/privacy contact mailbox is real and monitored (owner decision;
  `play-store-listing.md` / `play-console-submit.md` / `PRIVACY.md` / `privacy-policy/index.html`).
- **D-3** Shaders O-Log2 inverse-threshold discrepancy — decide with OPPO's white paper in hand;
  do not hot-patch the shipping OETF blind.
- **D-4** structural refactors (state triplication/applyExtras, CameraEngine split, AE-loop move,
  CameraSession seam, caps projection out of CameraUiState, telemetry-flow split, typed engine
  events) — MUST land before the CameraUnit / item-#4 v2 work.
- **D-5..D-9** perf items needing device measurement (downsampled analysis readback, startRecording
  off main, async DNG write, single-decode HEIF+JPEG, GL frame coalescing / cached request builder /
  waveform draw reuse).
- **D-10** MR-bank management placement (IA decision), **D-11** AE metering under LOG preview,
  **D-12** dead backup_rules removal (needs explicit owner sign-off — file deletion),
  **D-13** pure-env release signing gate (when CI exists), **D-14** keep-screen-on toggle (already
  above), **D-15** FnSlot table test on next enum growth, **D-16** OPPO Maven cred relocation (with
  the CameraUnit AUTH_CODE work), **D-17** GyroEis roll wrap transient (cosmetic), **D-18** the
  lit-scene/human-ears residual field checks (above).
